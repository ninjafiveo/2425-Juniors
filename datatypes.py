# "#" Comments the code - so that humans can read it, but the program ignores it. 
# Uses Comments to communicate what your code does.

# Strings - Strings are words/characters.
first_name = "Michael" # Strings have to be inside of " double quotes" or 'single quotes'
# the quotes have to match. You can't have "Hi' a double quote matched with a single quote.
print(first_name)

# Side note: the assignment operator & variables. "=" is the assignment operator. It is a command that says the variable name is equal to the value. So first_name = "Michael", is a command telling first_name is "Michael"

# int --> Integers. These are whole numbers: -5, -4, -3, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... 506,322
user_age = 99
print(user_age)

# floats --> These are numbers with decimal points. 97.6, 101.2
patient_temp = 97.6
print(patient_temp)
